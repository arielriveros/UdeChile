/* Dima, Inna and Seryozha have gathered in a room. That's right, 
someone's got to go. To cheer Seryozha up and inspire him to have a walk, Inna decided to cook something.
Dima and Seryozha have n fruits in the fridge. Each fruit has two parameters: 
the taste and the number of calories. Inna decided to make a fruit salad, 
so she wants to take some fruits from the fridge for it. Inna follows a certain 
principle as she chooses the fruits: the total taste to the total calories ratio 
of the chosen fruits must equal k. 
Inna hasn't chosen the fruits yet, she is thinking: what is the maximum taste of the chosen fruits 
if she strictly follows her principle? Help Inna solve this culinary problem â€” now 
the happiness of a young couple is in your hands!
Inna loves Dima very much so she wants to make the salad from at least one fruit. */
